# 2020 Internship

The goal of this project is to gain a better understanding of the Allele Frequency Spectrum of n-island demographic models and how they relate to those of panmictic populations.

Description of .py files:
* validation_script.py : *compute AFS* of panmictic model and n-islands model generated by qmd, ms; and the *distance* between qmd's and ms's output. All results are saved in (values, errors) csv files . 

* performance_script.py : *compute RUNTIME* of qmd and ms of nislands, which genertates csv files. 

* validation_visualised.py  : *visualise* the accuracy of ms. 

* performance_visualised.py : *visualise the comparison of runtimes* between qmd and ms with different migration rates, same nsegsites, same number of islands, same sampling_scheme, same omega. 

* compare_accuracy_diff_num_islands.py : *compute and visualise* the comparison of accuracy of ms when computing n-islands with different numbers of islands. 

* compare_runtime_num_islands.py : *compute and visualise* runtime of n-islands with different numbers of islands. 

* converge1.py and area_chart: *visualise* afs of n-islands model getting similar to panmictic model when migration rate gets larger.
